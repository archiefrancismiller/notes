# NOTES
A. Francis Miller 04/11/2025

This is my .plan file; mostly notes on game development, but I'm certain other hobbies will sneak in. It's a list of learnings, observations, and solutions to problems I've encountered. I'm apt to forget all this stuff if I don't write it down somewhere, and hopefully other people will benefit from it too.
