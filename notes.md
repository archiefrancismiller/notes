This is my .plan file.

It will host notes, observations, learnings, and solutions to problems I've encountered in game development. I'm apt to forget all this stuff if I don't write it down somewhere. Hopefully other people will benefit from it too.

While horizontal momentum is not preserved when jumping, it has the snappy feel you won't get from YouTube tutorials.
